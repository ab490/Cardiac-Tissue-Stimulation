# Cardiac-Tissue-Stimulation
During stimulation of the cardiac tissue through a small anode, the tissue under the electrode and in the direction perpendicular to the myocardial fibers is hyper-polarized, and adjacent tissue on each side of the anode parallel to the fiber direction is depolarized. Just before this stimulus pulse is turned on, the tissue is refractory. The hyperpolarization during the stimulus causes the tissue to become excitable. Following the end of the stimulus pulse, the depolarization along the fiber direction interacts electrotonically with the excitable tissue, initiating an action potential (break excitation). 

Studied and analysed the stimulation of the cardiac tissue through anode and cathode electrodes.
